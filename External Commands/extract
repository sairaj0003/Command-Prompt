The extract command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to extract files from a Microsoft Cabinet (.cab) file. It is similar in functionality to the expand command and was traditionally used for file compression and decompression in early versions of Windows.
Here are the details:

    Use: The extract command is used to extract files from a cabinet (.cab) file.

    Syntax:
        extract [/Y] [/A] [/D:destination] source [newname] [/L]
    
        /Y: Suppresses prompting to confirm the overwrite of existing files.
        /A: Forces all files to be extracted.
        /D:destination: Specifies the destination directory for the extracted files.
        source: Specifies the source cabinet file.
        newname: Specifies a new name for the extracted file(s).
        /L: Displays a list of the files stored in the cabinet.

    Example:
        extract /Y /A /D:C:\ExtractedFiles filename.cab
    
        This example extracts all files from the "filename.cab" file into the "C:\ExtractedFiles" directory, overwriting existing files without prompting.

    Additional Information:
        The extract command was commonly used in the era of Windows 95, Windows 98, and early versions of Windows NT.
        It is less commonly used in modern Windows systems, as newer compression and extraction tools are available.
        More modern alternatives for file compression and extraction include tools like zip, unzip, or third-party software.

Keep in mind that the use of the extract command is less prevalent in contemporary Windows environments, where users typically rely on more modern and versatile compression utilities.
