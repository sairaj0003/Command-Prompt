The netstat command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to display active network connections, listening ports, and related network statistics. It provides a snapshot of the network status on a local machine.
Here are the details:

    Use: The netstat command is used to display information about active network connections, listening ports, and network statistics.

    Syntax:
        netstat [-a] [-b] [-e] [-f] [-n] [-o] [-p protocol] [-r] [-s] [-t] [-x] [interval]
    
        Various options control the information displayed (e.g., -a for all connections and listening ports, -b to display executable involved in creating each connection).

    Examples:
        Display all active connections and listening ports:
            netstat -a
        
        Display the PID (Process ID) associated with each connection:
            netstat -ano
        
        Display statistics for network protocols:
            netstat -s

    Additional Information:
        netstat is useful for diagnosing network-related issues, identifying active connections, and monitoring network activity.
        The command can show information about TCP, UDP, and other protocols.
        The -o option displays the PID associated with each connection, allowing users to correlate network activity with specific processes.

For a complete list of options and additional details, you can use netstat /? in the Command Prompt. Keep in mind that some options may require administrative privileges to display certain information.
