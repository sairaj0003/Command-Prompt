The tree command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to display the folder and file structure of a directory and its subdirectories in a tree-like format. It provides a hierarchical view of the directory structure, making it easier to understand the organization of files and folders.
Here are the details:

    Use: The tree command is used to display the directory structure in a tree format.

    Syntax:
        tree [drive:][path] [/F] [/A]
    
        [drive:][path]: Specifies the directory for which the tree structure should be displayed.
        /F: Display the names of the files in each directory.
        /A: Use ASCII characters to draw the tree lines.

    Examples:
        Display the tree structure for the current directory:
            tree
        
        Display the tree structure for a specific directory with file names:
            tree C:\Example /F

    Additional Information:
        The tree command is a useful tool for visualizing the hierarchy of files and directories in a given path.
        By default, it displays the tree structure without file names. The /F option can be used to include file names in the output.
        The /A option allows you to use ASCII characters to draw the tree lines, providing an alternative visual representation.

For more details and options, you can use tree /? in the Command Prompt. The tree command is often used for quick assessments of directory structures, especially when you need to understand the layout of files and folders.
