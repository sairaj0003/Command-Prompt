The doskey command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to enable or disable the command recall and editing features, as well as to create macros.
Here are the details:

    Use: The doskey command is used to enable or disable the command recall and editing features in the Windows Command Prompt. It can also be used to create command macros.

    Syntax:
        doskey [/reinstall] [/listsize=size] [/macrofile=filename] [/history] [/insert | /overstrike] [/exename=exename] [/macroname=macroname] [macroname=[text]]

        /reinstall: Installs a new copy of Doskey.
        /listsize=size: Sets the size of the command history buffer.
        /macrofile=filename: Specifies a file containing macros.
        /history: Displays all commands stored in memory.
        /insert or /overstrike: Specifies whether to use the overstrike or insert mode for editing.
        /exename=exename: Specifies an executable file other than COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE.
        /macroname=macroname: Specifies a name to use for a macro.
        macroname=[text]: Specifies a macro definition.

    Example:
        doskey /history
        
        This example displays the command history.

        doskey ls=dir
    
        This example creates a macro named "ls" that maps to the "dir" command.

    Additional Information:
        doskey is useful for enhancing the command-line experience by providing command recall, editing, and macro capabilities.
        Macros created with doskey allow you to define shortcuts for longer command sequences.
        The /history option shows the list of previously executed commands.

While doskey is available in the Windows Command Prompt, its usage may be more common in legacy or specific scripting scenarios. Modern PowerShell and other command-line tools provide enhanced features and scripting capabilities.
