The arp command in the command prompt is used to display and manage the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, which is a table that maps IP addresses to physical (MAC) addresses on a local network. Here are the details:

    Use: The arp command is used for viewing and manipulating the ARP cache.

    Syntax: The basic syntax is:
        arp [-a] [-g] [-d] [-n [inet_addr]] [-s [inet_addr eth_addr]] [-d [inet_addr]] [-?]

        -a: Displays the ARP table.
        -g: Same as -a.
        -d: Deletes an entry specified by the inet_addr.
        -n: Displays numerical addresses instead of resolving names.
        -s: Adds a static ARP entry.
        -?: Displays help information.

    Example:
        Display ARP table:
            arp -a

        Add a static ARP entry:
            arp -s 192.168.1.1 00-11-22-33-44-55

        Delete an ARP entry:
            arp -d 192.168.1.1

        These examples assume a local network and provide basic usage of the arp command. Adjust the IP addresses and MAC addresses according to your network configuration.
