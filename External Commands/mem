The mem command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to display information about memory usage on the system. However, it's worth noting that the mem command is a legacy command from MS-DOS, and on modern versions of Windows, it may not provide detailed or accurate information about system memory usage.
Here are the details:

    Use: The mem command displays information about memory usage, including the total memory, free memory, and memory used by the system.

    Syntax:
        mem
        
    Additional Information:
        In MS-DOS, the mem command was used to view information about available memory. However, with the transition to Windows NT-based operating systems (Windows 2000 and later), the mem command became less relevant, and more advanced tools like Task Manager or PowerShell are used to monitor system resources.
        On modern Windows systems, you might use tools such as Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) or PowerShell commands like Get-Process for more detailed and up-to-date information about memory usage.

If you are using a more recent version of Windows and are interested in current memory information, I recommend using Task Manager or other system monitoring tools provided by Windows.
