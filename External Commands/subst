The subst command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to associate a drive letter with a specific folder on a local or network drive. It allows you to create a virtual drive letter that points to a specific path, making it convenient to access frequently used directories.
Here are the details:

    Use: The subst command is used to create a virtual drive letter that points to a specific folder.

    Syntax:
        subst [drive1: [drive2:]path]
    
        drive1:: Specifies the virtual drive letter to be created.
        [drive2:]path: Specifies the target folder that the virtual drive letter will point to.

    Examples:
        Create a virtual drive letter "Z:" pointing to the folder "C:\MyFolder":
            subst Z: C:\MyFolder
        
        Remove the virtual drive letter "Z:":
            subst Z: /D

    Additional Information:
        The subst command is useful for creating virtual drives to access specific directories more conveniently.
        Virtual drives created with subst are temporary and exist only for the current session. They are removed when the computer restarts.
        To make virtual drives persistent across reboots, you can use the subst command in a script that runs at startup or use other methods like modifying the system registry.
        It's important to note that while subst can be a convenient tool, it's not as commonly used in modern Windows environments, as mapped network drives and shortcuts are often preferred.

For more details and options, you can use subst /? in the Command Prompt. The subst command is a legacy command that may still be useful in certain scenarios, especially for specific file and directory access patterns.
