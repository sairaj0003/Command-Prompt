The runas command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to run a program or command as another user. This is particularly useful for executing commands with elevated privileges or for running programs under a different user account.
Here are the details:

    Use: The runas command is used to run a program or command with different user credentials.

    Syntax:
        runas [{/profile | /noprofile}] [/env] [/netonly] [/smartcard] [/showtrustlevels] [/trustlevel] /user:username program
    
        /profile: Loads the user's profile.
        /noprofile: Does not load the user's profile.
        /env: Uses the current environment instead of the user's.
        /netonly: Specifies that the command should be run with the credentials specified, but on the network.
        /smartcard: Specifies that the credentials should be supplied from a smartcard.
        /showtrustlevels: Displays the trust levels that can be used with the /trustlevel switch.
        /trustlevel: Specifies the minimum trust level required to run the program.

    Examples:
        Run Command Prompt as an administrator:
            runas /user:Administrator cmd
        
        Run Notepad as a different user:
            runas /user:domain\username "notepad.exe"

    Additional Information:
        The runas command is often used when administrative privileges are required for executing specific commands or programs.
        It prompts for the password of the specified user if necessary.
        It can be useful for troubleshooting or performing administrative tasks without having to switch users or log in and out.
        When using runas to execute commands with elevated privileges, you may encounter the UAC (User Account Control) prompt, requesting confirmation.

For more details and options, you can use runas /? in the Command Prompt. Note that using the runas command may require appropriate permissions and credentials.
