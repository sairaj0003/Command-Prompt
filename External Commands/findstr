The findstr command in the Windows Command Prompt is used for searching strings in files. It is a more powerful and versatile version of the find command, providing various options for pattern matching and text searching.
Here are the details:

    Use: The findstr command is used to search for a specific string or regular expression in files.

    Syntax:
        findstr [/B] [/E] [/L] [/R] [/S] [/I] [/X] [/V] [/N] [/M] [/O] [/P] [/F:file] [/C:string] [/G:file] [/D:dir list] [/A:color attributes] [/OFF[LINE]] [string [filename(s)]]
    
        /B: Matches the pattern if it is at the beginning of a line.
        /E: Matches the pattern if it is at the end of a line.
        /L: Treats the search string as a literal string.
        /R: Uses search strings as regular expressions.
        /S: Searches for matching files in the current directory and all subdirectories.
        /I: Specifies that the search is not case-sensitive.
        /X: Prints lines that match exactly.
        /V: Prints only lines that do not contain the specified string.
        /N: Prints the line number before each line that matches.
        /M: Prints only the file names that contain the specified string.
        /O: Prints character offset before each matching line.
        /P: Skip files with non-printable characters.
        /F:file: Reads file names from the specified file.
        /C:string: Uses specified string as a literal search string.
        /G:file: Gets search strings from the specified file.
        /D:dir list: Searches for the specified string in this directory list.
        /A:color attributes: Specifies color attributes with two hex digits.

    Example:
        findstr /S /I "example" C:\Files\*.txt
    
        This example searches for the case-insensitive string "example" in all .txt files in the "C:\Files" directory and its subdirectories.

    Additional Information:
