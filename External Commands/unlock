Unlocking a BitLocker-protected drive

If you have a BitLocker-protected drive, you can use the manage-bde command to unlock it. To do this, open CMD and type the following command:
    manage-bde unlock <drive letter> -pw

    Replace <drive letter> with the drive letter of the BitLocker-protected drive you want to unlock. You will then be prompted to enter your BitLocker password.
