The expand command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to extract files from a Microsoft Cabinet (.cab) file. It was traditionally used for file compression and decompression in early versions of Windows.
Here are the details:

    Use: The expand command is used to extract files from a cabinet (.cab) file.

    Syntax:
        expand [-r] source [destination]
    
        -r: Recursively extracts files from subdirectories.
        source: Specifies the source cabinet file.
        destination: Specifies the destination directory for the extracted files.

    Example:
        expand -r filename.cab C:\ExtractedFiles
    
        This example extracts all files from the "filename.cab" file into the "C:\ExtractedFiles" directory.

    Additional Information:
        The expand command was commonly used in the era of Windows 95, Windows 98, and early versions of Windows NT.
        It is less commonly used in modern Windows systems, as newer compression and extraction tools are available.
        More modern alternatives for file compression and extraction include tools like zip, unzip, or third-party software.

It's important to note that the use of the expand command is less prevalent in contemporary Windows environments, where users typically rely on more modern and versatile compression utilities.
