The fdisk command is a utility in the Windows Command Prompt used for managing disk partitions on a hard drive. It was traditionally used in MS-DOS and early versions of Windows for disk partitioning tasks.
Here are the details:

    Use: The fdisk command is used to create, delete, and manage partitions on a hard disk.

    Syntax:
        fdisk [/status] [/pri[:n]] [/ext[:n]] [/log[:n]] [/mbr] [/displayorder[:{n|ordinal}]]
    
        /status: Displays the current partition status.
        /pri[:n]: Sets the specified primary partition active.
        /ext[:n]: Sets the specified extended partition active.
        /log[:n]: Sets the specified logical partition active.
        /mbr: Writes a new Master Boot Record (MBR) on the system partition.
        /displayorder[:{n|ordinal}]: Changes the operating system boot display order.

    Example:
        fdisk /status
    
        This example displays the current partition status of the hard disk.

    Additional Information:
        The fdisk command is more commonly associated with MS-DOS and early versions of Windows, such as Windows 95 and Windows 98.
        Modern Windows operating systems, starting with Windows 2000 and later, use different utilities like Disk Management for disk partitioning tasks.
        The use of fdisk requires careful consideration and understanding of disk partitioning, as improper use can lead to data loss.

For disk management tasks on modern Windows systems, it is recommended to use the Disk Management tool, which provides a more user-friendly interface and additional features for managing partitions. The use of fdisk is typically limited to specific scenarios or legacy systems.
