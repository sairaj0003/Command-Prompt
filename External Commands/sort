The sort command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to sort the contents of a text file or the output of a command. It arranges lines of text alphabetically or numerically, depending on the specified options.
Here are the details:

    Use: The sort command is used for sorting text.

    Syntax:
        sort [/r] [/m] [/l] [/n] [/rec] [/+n] [/o output] [input]
    
        /r: Reverses the sort order.
        /m: Specifies that the input should be sorted in memory.
        /l: Forces the input to be sorted in lowercase.
        /n: Specifies a numeric sort.
        /rec: Specifies the number of characters in each record.
        /+n: Specifies the starting character position for the sort key.
        /o output: Specifies the file where the sorted input is to be stored.

    Examples:
        Sort the contents of a text file alphabetically:
            sort input.txt
        
        Sort the contents of a text file in reverse order:
            sort /r input.txt
        
        Sort the output of a command numerically:
            dir /b | sort /n

    Additional Information:
        The sort command is useful for organizing text data in a desired order.
        By default, sort arranges text in ascending order. The /r option can be used to reverse the sort order.
        The /n option is used for numeric sorting, while the /l option forces sorting in lowercase.
        If no input file is specified, sort reads from the standard input (keyboard or pipeline).

For more details and options, you can use sort /? in the Command Prompt. The sort command is commonly used in batch scripts and command-line operations where data needs to be organized or processed in a specific order.
