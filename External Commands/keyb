The keyb command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to configure a keyboard for a specific language. It allows users to set the keyboard layout and code page used by the system.
Here are the details:

    Use: The keyb command is used to configure the keyboard layout and code page.

    Syntax:
        keyb [keyboard layout code] [keyboard code page] [/d]
    
        [keyboard layout code]: Specifies the keyboard layout code (e.g., us for U.S. layout).
        [keyboard code page]: Specifies the keyboard code page (e.g., 437 for U.S.).
        /d: Displays the current keyboard layout and code page.

    Example:
        keyb us 437
    
        This example sets the keyboard layout to U.S. and the code page to 437.

    Additional Information:
        The keyb command is often used to configure the keyboard for different languages and regional settings.
        It is particularly relevant in MS-DOS and early versions of Windows.
        Modern Windows operating systems typically handle keyboard configuration through the Control Panel or Settings interface, and the use of keyb is less common.

Keep in mind that the availability and functionality of certain commands can vary across different Windows versions. If you are using a more recent version of Windows, you might find that keyboard configuration is managed through graphical interfaces rather than the Command Prompt.
