The "append" command in the context of the command prompt in Windows is not a standalone command. However, if you're referring to the ">>" operator, it is used for appending output to a file. Here's the information:

    Use: The ">>" operator is used to append the output of a command to the end of a file without overwriting the existing content.

    Syntax: The basic syntax is:
        command >> filename

    Example:
        echo "This is a new line" >> example.txt
        This example appends the text "This is a new line" to the file named "example.txt". If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it exists, the text will be added to the end of the file.
