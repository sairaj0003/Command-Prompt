The at command in the Windows command prompt is used to schedule commands and programs to run at a specified date and time. Here are the details:

    Use: The at command allows you to schedule tasks to run in the background at a specified time.

    Syntax:
        at [\\computername] [ [id] [/delete] | /delete /yes]

        \\computername: Specifies a remote computer. If this parameter is omitted, the tasks on the local computer are displayed.
        [id]: Specifies the identification number assigned to a scheduled task.
        /delete: Cancels a scheduled task.
        /yes: Used with /delete to delete all scheduled tasks on the computer.

    Example:
        at 15:30 /every:M,T,W,Th,F "notepad.exe"

        This example schedules the Notepad application (notepad.exe) to run every weekday at 3:30 PM.
        
    Additional Information:
        The at command allows you to schedule a command or program to run once at a specific time or repeatedly on specific days of the week.
        The scheduled tasks created with at are managed by the Task Scheduler service.
        You need to have the "Task Scheduler" service running to use the at command.
