The tracert command, short for "traceroute," is used in the Windows Command Prompt to trace the route that packets take to reach a destination on a network. It helps to identify the network path, latency, and potential issues between the source and destination.
Here are the details:

    Use: The tracert command is used to trace the route that packets take to reach a destination.

    Syntax:
        tracert [options] [hostname or IP address]
    
        [hostname or IP address]: Specifies the destination host or IP address.
        [options]: Various options that modify the behavior of the tracert command.

    Examples:
        Trace the route to a specific website:
            tracert www.example.com
        
        Trace the route to a specific IP address:
            tracert 203.0.113.1

    Additional Information:
        tracert sends a sequence of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages to the destination with increasing Time-To-Live (TTL) values.
        Each router or hop along the path decrements the TTL, and when the TTL reaches zero, the router sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source.
        The output of tracert includes the IP addresses of each router or hop, along with round-trip times (latency).
        tracert is a valuable tool for diagnosing network connectivity issues, identifying bottlenecks, and understanding the network path to a specific destination.

For more details and options, you can use tracert /? in the Command Prompt. Note that the availability and behavior of tracert may vary on different operating systems and network environments.
