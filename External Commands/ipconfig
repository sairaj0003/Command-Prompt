The ipconfig command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to display the configuration of network interfaces on a Windows system. It provides information about IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and other network-related details.
Here are the details:

    Use: The ipconfig command is used to retrieve network configuration information.

    Syntax:
        ipconfig [/all] [/renew] [/release] [/flushdns] [/displaydns] [/registerdns] [/showclassid adapter] [/setclassid adapter [classid]]
    
        /all: Displays detailed configuration information for all interfaces.
        /renew: Renews the DHCP configuration for all adapters.
        /release: Releases the IP configuration for all adapters.
        /flushdns: Flushes and resets the contents of the DNS client resolver cache.
        /displaydns: Displays the contents of the DNS client resolver cache.
        /registerdns: Initiates manual registration of the DNS names and IP addresses that the computer has registered with the DNS server.
        /showclassid adapter: Displays the DHCP class ID for a specified adapter.
        /setclassid adapter [classid]: Configures the DHCP class ID for a specified adapter.

    Example:
        ipconfig /all
    
        This example displays detailed configuration information for all network interfaces.

    Additional Information:
        ipconfig is a versatile command that is commonly used for troubleshooting network-related issues.
        Running ipconfig without any parameters displays basic information about the active network interfaces.
        The /renew and /release options are often used to refresh or obtain new IP addresses from a DHCP server.
        The /flushdns option is useful for clearing the DNS resolver cache, which can be helpful when troubleshooting DNS-related problems.

Keep in mind that some options, especially those related to renewing or releasing IP addresses, may require administrative privileges. Therefore, you may need to run the Command Prompt as an administrator to execute certain ipconfig commands.
