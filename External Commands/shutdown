The shutdown command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to shut down, restart, or log off a computer. It allows you to initiate these actions from the command line.
Here are the details:

    Use: The shutdown command is used for shutting down, restarting, or logging off a computer.

    Syntax:
        shutdown [/i | /l | /s | /r | /g | /a | /p | /h | /e] [/f] [/m \\computer][/t xxx][/d [p|u:]xx:yy [/c "comment"]]
    
        /i: Displays the graphical user interface (GUI) allowing the user to log off, restart, or shut down the computer.
        /l: Logs off the current user.
        /s: Shuts down the computer.
        /r: Restarts the computer.
        /g: Restart and reopens any running applications after a system restart (Windows 8 and later).
        /a: Aborts a system shutdown.
        /p: Turns off the computer (power off).
        /h: Puts the computer into hibernation.
        /e: Document the reason for an unexpected shutdown.
        /f: Forces running applications to close during the shutdown.
        /m \\computer: Specifies the target computer.
        /t xxx: Sets the time delay in seconds before performing the action.
        /d [p|u:]xx:yy: Provides the reason code for the shutdown.

    Examples:
        Shutdown the local computer after a 60-second delay:
            shutdown /s /t 60
        
        Restart the computer immediately:
            shutdown /r /t 0
        
        Log off the current user:
            shutdown /l

    Additional Information:
        Administrative privileges are typically required for certain actions, such as shutting down or restarting the computer.
        The /i option opens a GUI interface that allows you to perform various shutdown-related tasks, including remote shutdowns.
        The /a option can be used to abort a system shutdown if executed quickly after initiating the shutdown.
        The /f option can be useful to force applications to close, but it may result in unsaved data loss.

For more details and options, you can use shutdown /? in the Command Prompt. The shutdown command is often used for automation, scripting, or remotely managing computers.
