nlsfunc loads country-specific information for national language support (NLS). It allows you to switch between different character sets and use country-specific features, such as date and time formats, currency symbols, and sorting rules.

    Syntax:
        nlsfunc [[drive:][path]filename]

        filename: The name of the file containing country-specific information. This file is typically located in the LANG directory of the MS-DOS installation.

    Examples:
        nlsfunc a:\lang\Spain.dat: This command loads the country-specific information for Spain.
    
        nlsfunc c:\dos\nlsfunc.exe a:\lang\France.dat: This command loads the country-specific information for France.

    Note:
        The nlsfunc command should not be used while Windows is running. If you do so, your computer might stop responding.
    
        The nlsfunc command can also be used in the CONFIG.SYS file to automatically load country-specific information when you start your computer. To do this, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:
    
        INSTALL=[[dos-drive:]dos-path]NLSFUNC.EXE [country-filename]
        
        Replace [dos-drive:]dos-path] with the location of NLSFUNC.EXE and [country-filename] with the name of the file containing country-specific information.
