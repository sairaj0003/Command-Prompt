The cd command in the Windows command prompt (cmd) is used to change the current working directory. It is also available in Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) and the command prompt in those environments.
Here are the details:

    Use: The cd command is used to change the current working directory.

    Syntax:
        cd [drive:][path]

        [drive:][path]: Specifies the drive and directory to change to. If only the drive is specified, it changes the current drive without changing the directory.

    Example:
        cd C:\Example

        This example changes the current working directory to "C:\Example."

    Additional Information:
        Using cd without any arguments will switch to the user's home directory.
        The /D option can be used to change both the current drive and the current directory, like this: cd /D D:\AnotherExample.
