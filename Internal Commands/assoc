The assoc command in the Windows command prompt is used to display or modify file name extension associations. Here are the details:

    Use: The assoc command is used to view or change the file extension associations on a system.

    Syntax:
        assoc [.ext=[fileType]]

        .ext: Specifies the file extension.
        fileType: Specifies the file type to associate with the specified file extension.

    Example:
        assoc .txt=txtfile

        This example associates the file extension .txt with the file type txtfile. After running this command, double-clicking a .txt file would open it with the default program associated with the txtfile file type.
    Additional Information:
        To view the current file associations, you can run assoc without any arguments: assoc.
        To remove a file association, you can use the assoc command with the file extension followed by nothing. For example: assoc .txt=.
        Changing file associations can impact how files are opened and processed by default applications.
