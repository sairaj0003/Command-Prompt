The convert command is primarily used for converting a FAT or FAT32 file system to NTFS without losing data. This command is part of the Windows Command Prompt utility.
Here are the details:

    Use: The convert command in Windows is used to convert a FAT or FAT32 file system to NTFS.

    Syntax:
        convert [volume] /fs:ntfs

        [volume]: Specifies the drive letter or mount point of the volume to convert.
        /fs:ntfs: Specifies the target file system, in this case, NTFS.

    Example:
        convert C: /fs:ntfs

        This example converts the file system of the C: drive from FAT32 to NTFS.

    Additional Information:
        The convert command is a useful tool when you want to take advantage of NTFS features without reformatting the entire drive.
        Conversion from FAT or FAT32 to NTFS is non-destructive, meaning it doesn't delete data on the drive during the conversion process.
        Ensure that you have a backup of your important data before performing any file system conversion.
