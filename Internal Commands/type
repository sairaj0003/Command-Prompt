The type command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to display the contents of a text file. It simply outputs the text content of a file to the console.
Here are the details:

    Use: The type command is used to display the contents of a text file.

    Syntax:
        type [drive:][path]filename
    
        [drive:][path]filename: Specifies the path and name of the text file whose contents you want to display.

    Examples:
        Display the contents of a text file:
            type C:\Example\sample.txt
        
        Display the contents of a text file in the current directory:
            type sample.txt

    Additional Information:
        The type command is commonly used to quickly view the contents of small text files directly in the Command Prompt.
        It's important to note that type may not be suitable for viewing large files, as it will attempt to display the entire content, potentially overwhelming the console.
        If you need to view or manipulate larger files, you may want to consider using other commands or text editors better suited for such tasks.

For more details and options, you can use type /? in the Command Prompt.
