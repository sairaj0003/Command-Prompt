The pushd command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to change the current directory and also stores the current directory on a stack so that it can be returned to later using the popd command.
Here are the details:

    Use: The pushd command is used to change the current directory and save the current directory onto a stack.

    Syntax:
        pushd [path]
    
        [path]: Specifies the directory to change to. If no path is provided, it changes to the current user's home directory.

    Examples:
        Change to a specific directory and store the current directory on the stack:
            pushd C:\Example
        
        Change to the user's home directory and store the current directory on the stack:
            pushd %HOMEPATH%

    Additional Information:
        The pushd command not only changes the current directory but also stores the current directory on a stack, allowing you to return to it later using popd.
        After using pushd, you can use popd to return to the directory that was on top of the stack.
        This can be useful for navigating between directories, especially in batch scripts or command prompt sessions.
