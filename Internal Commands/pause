The pause command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to make the Command Prompt wait for user input before proceeding with the execution of a batch file. When the pause command is encountered in a batch script, it displays the message "Press any key to continue..." and waits for the user to press a key.
Here are the details:

    Use: The pause command is used to insert a pause or wait for user input in a batch script.

    Syntax:
        pause
    
        When this command is encountered in a batch script, it prompts the user to press any key.

    Example:
        @echo off
        echo This is a batch script.
        pause
        echo Script continued after pause.

    Additional Information:
        The pause command is often used in batch scripts to pause the execution of the script, allowing the user to review information or confirm an action before proceeding.
        It is commonly used with the @echo off command to prevent echoing of the commands to the console.
        Once the user presses any key, the script continues with the next command.

The pause command is a simple but useful tool for batch script development, especially when user interaction or confirmation is needed.
