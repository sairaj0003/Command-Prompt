The chdir command is an alternative name for the cd command in the Windows command prompt. Both cd and chdir are used to change the current working directory.
Here are the details:

    Use: The chdir command, just like the cd command, is used to change the current working directory.

    Syntax:
        chdir [drive:][path]

        [drive:][path]: Specifies the drive and directory to change to. If only the drive is specified, it changes the current drive without changing the directory.

    Example:
        chdir C:\Example

        This example changes the current working directory to "C:\Example."

    Additional Information:
        In Windows command prompt, chdir and cd are interchangeable; both can be used to achieve the same result of changing the current working directory.
        The /D option can be used with chdir (or cd) to change both the current drive and the current directory, like this: chdir /D D:\AnotherExample.

The primary use of chdir is to change directories, and it serves the same purpose as the cd command in the Windows command prompt.
