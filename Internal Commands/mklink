The mklink command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to create symbolic links or hard links between files or directories. Symbolic links are references to a file or directory, and hard links are additional file system entries that refer to the same file content.
Here are the details:

    Use: The mklink command is used to create symbolic links or hard links.

    Syntax:
        mklink [/d] link target
    
        /d: Creates a directory symbolic link. By default, it creates a file symbolic link.
        link: Specifies the name of the symbolic link to be created.
        target: Specifies the path (relative or absolute) to the target file or directory.

    Examples:
        Creating a symbolic link to a file:

            mklink C:\LinkToFile.txt C:\OriginalFile.txt
        
        Creating a symbolic link to a directory:

            mklink /d C:\LinkToDirectory C:\OriginalDirectory

    Additional Information:
        Symbolic links provide a way to reference a file or directory by a different name or location.
        Symbolic links can be used for various purposes, such as creating shortcuts or organizing files in a more convenient structure.
        Hard links allow multiple file system entries to point to the same file content. Changes to one entry affect all entries pointing to the same content.
        Administrative privileges are typically required to create symbolic links.
