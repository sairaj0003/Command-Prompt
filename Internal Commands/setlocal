The setlocal command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to start a local scope for environment variables. When you use setlocal, any changes made to the environment variables are local to the current script or batch file and do not affect the global environment. The changes are reversed when the endlocal command is encountered or when the script or batch file ends.
Here are the details:

    Use: The setlocal command is used to initiate a local environment scope.

    Syntax:
        setlocal [EnableDelayedExpansion]
    
        EnableDelayedExpansion: When specified, enables delayed environment variable expansion.

    Examples:
        Start a local scope:
            @echo off
            setlocal
        
        Start a local scope with delayed expansion enabled:
            @echo off
            setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion

    Additional Information:
        The setlocal command is often used in batch scripts to create a local environment scope, allowing changes to environment variables that won't affect the rest of the system.
        When the script or batch file ends or encounters the endlocal command, the changes made within the local scope are reverted, and the environment is restored to its previous state.
        Delayed expansion can be useful when working with variables in loops or conditional statements within batch scripts.

    Here's a simple example of a batch script that uses setlocal and endlocal:
        @echo off
        setlocal
        
        rem Set a local variable
        set LOCAL_VAR=123
        
        rem Display the local variable
        echo Local Variable: %LOCAL_VAR%
        
        endlocal
        
        rem The local variable is no longer accessible
        echo Local Variable outside of local scope: %LOCAL_VAR%
        
        In the example above, %LOCAL_VAR% is only accessible within the local scope created by setlocal. Once endlocal is encountered, the variable is no longer accessible.
