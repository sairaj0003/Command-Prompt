The move command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to move files or directories from one location to another. It is also used to rename files or directories.
Here are the details:

    Use: The move command is used to move files or directories from one location to another or to rename files or directories.

    Syntax:
        move [/Y | /-Y] [drive:][path]filename1[,...] destination
        move [/Y | /-Y] [drive:][path]filename1[,...] destination\
    
        /Y: Suppresses confirmation prompts, assuming Yes as the answer to all prompts.
        /-Y: Prompts to confirm file overwrites.

    Examples:
        Move a file to another directory:
            move C:\Source\File.txt D:\Destination\
        
        Rename a file:
            move C:\OldName.txt C:\NewName.txt
        
        Move multiple files to another directory:
            move *.txt D:\Destination\

    Additional Information:
        The move command can be used for both moving and renaming operations.
        If the destination is an existing directory, the source files or directories are moved into that directory.
        If the destination is a new filename, the source file is renamed to that filename.
        The /Y and /-Y options are used to control whether confirmation prompts are displayed for overwriting existing files.
