The rmdir command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to remove or delete a directory (folder). It's similar to the rd command, and both commands serve the same purpose of deleting directories.
Here are the details:

    Use: The rmdir command is used to delete a directory from the file system.

    Syntax:
        rmdir /s /q directory_path
    
        /s: Removes all directories and files in the specified directory in addition to the directory itself.
        /q: Enables quiet mode. You won't be prompted for confirmation when deleting a directory and its contents.

    Examples:
        Delete an empty directory:
            rmdir C:\Example
        
        Delete a directory and its contents:
            rmdir /s /q C:\Example

    Additional Information:
        The rmdir command is functionally equivalent to the rd command. Both commands are used to remove directories.
        Be cautious when using the /s and /q options, especially with wildcards, as it can result in the deletion of multiple directories and files without confirmation.
        If the directory is not empty and you use rmdir without the /s option, you'll receive an error message.

Always double-check the directory path before using rmdir, especially with the /s and /q options, to avoid unintentional data loss.
