The erase command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to delete one or more files. It is an alternative command to the more commonly used del command.
Here are the details:

    Use: The erase command is used to delete files from a specified location.

    Syntax:
        erase [/P] [/F] [/S] [/Q] [/A[[:]attributes]] names
    
        /P: Prompts for confirmation before deleting each file.
        /F: Forcefully deletes read-only files.
        /S: Deletes specified files from all subdirectories.
        /Q: Quiet mode (doesn't display confirmation prompts).
        /A[[:]attributes]: Selects files to delete based on attributes.
        names: Specifies the file or files to be deleted.

    Example:
        erase filename.txt
    
        This example deletes the file named "filename.txt" in the current directory.

    Additional Information:
        The erase command is functionally equivalent to the del command in modern Windows systems.
        It provides a way to delete files from the command prompt, and the options allow for additional control over the deletion process.
        Like del, using the erase command with wildcards (* and ?) can match and delete multiple files.

    Example with confirmation prompt:
        erase /P *.txt

        This example deletes all files with the ".txt" extension in the current directory, prompting for confirmation before each deletion. As always, use commands like erase with caution, especially when deleting multiple files, as the process is typically irreversible.
