The copy command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to copy one or more files from one location to another. It allows you to duplicate files or directories.
Here are the details:

    Use: The copy command is used to copy files or directories from one location to another.

    Syntax:
        copy [/D] [/V] [/N] [/Y | /-Y] [/Z] [/A | /B ] source [/A | /B] [+ source [/A | /B] [+ ...]] [destination [/A | /B]]

        /D: Allow the destination file to be created decrypted.
        /V: Verifies that new files are written correctly.
        /N: Uses short file names, if available, when copying a file with a non-8dot3 name.
        /Y: Suppresses prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an existing destination file.
        /-Y: Prompts you to confirm you want to overwrite an existing destination file.
        /Z: Copies networked files in restartable mode.
        /A: Indicates an ASCII text file.
        /B: Indicates a binary file.
        source: Specifies the file or files to be copied.
        destination: Specifies the directory and/or filename for the new file(s).

    Example:
        copy C:\Example\file.txt D:\Backup\
    
        This example copies the file "file.txt" from the "C:\Example" directory to the "D:\Backup" directory.

    Additional Information:
        If the destination is not specified, the copy command will assume the current directory.
        You can use wildcards (* and ?) to copy multiple files matching a pattern.
        To copy entire directories with their contents, you can use the xcopy command.

The copy command is a fundamental tool for file management in the Windows Command Prompt, allowing you to duplicate files easily.
