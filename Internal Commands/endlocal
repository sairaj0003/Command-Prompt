The endlocal command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to end the localization of environment changes in a batch script. It is typically used in conjunction with the setlocal command to limit the scope of environment variable changes to a specific portion of the script.
Here are the details:

    Use: The endlocal command ends the localization of environment changes made within a specific block of code initiated by the setlocal command.

    Syntax:
        endlocal
        
        This command is usually used at the end of a block of code within a batch script.

    Example:
        @echo off
        setlocal
        echo This is a local environment.
        endlocal
        echo This is the global environment.

    Additional Information:
        When setlocal is used, it initializes a local environment, and any changes made to environment variables within that block are temporary and don't affect the global environment.
        The endlocal command is used to terminate the local environment and revert to the global environment.
        This mechanism is useful for preventing unintended side effects on global environment variables caused by changes within a specific portion of a script.

Batch scripts often use setlocal and endlocal to create isolated environments, ensuring that changes made to environment variables within a specific script segment do not affect the overall system or other parts of the script.
