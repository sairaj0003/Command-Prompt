The path command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to display or set the command search path for executable files. The command search path is a list of directories where the system looks for executable files when you enter a command without specifying its full path.
Here are the details:

    Use: The path command is used to display or set the command search path.

    Syntax:
        path [directory1;directory2;...]
    
        If used without any arguments, it displays the current command search path.
        If used with directories, it sets the command search path to the specified directories.
    
    Examples:
        Display the current command search path:
            path
        
        Set the command search path to include additional directories:
            path C:\Program Files\MyApp;%PATH%
        
            This example adds "C:\Program Files\MyApp" to the command search path.

    Additional Information:
        The command search path is a list of directories separated by semicolons (;), and the system searches for executable files in these directories in the order they appear in the path.
        When you enter a command, the system looks for the corresponding executable file in each directory in the path until it finds the executable or exhausts the search path.
        Modifying the path can be useful when you want to include directories containing executable files that you want to be accessible from any location in the command prompt.
