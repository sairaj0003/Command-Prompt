The popd command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to change the current directory to the one most recently stored by the pushd command. It is part of a pair of commands (pushd and popd) that allows you to navigate between directories more easily.
Here are the details:

    Use: The popd command is used to change the current directory to the one most recently stored by the pushd command.

    Syntax:
        popd
        
        When this command is executed, it removes the top directory from the stack (the one most recently pushed by pushd) and sets the current directory to that location.

    Example:
        pushd C:\Example
        popd
        
        In this example, pushd is used to change the current directory to C:\Example, and then popd is used to return to the directory that was active before the pushd command was executed.

    Additional Information:
        The pushd and popd commands are often used together to simplify directory navigation in batch scripts.
        The pushd command saves the current directory to a stack and changes to a new directory, while popd retrieves the directory from the top of the stack, making it the current directory.
        This is useful for scenarios where you need to temporarily change directories and then return to the original directory.
