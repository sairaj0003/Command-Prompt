The mkdir command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to create a new directory or folder. The command stands for "make directory."
Here are the details:

    Use: The mkdir command is used to create a new directory or folder in the specified path.

    Syntax:
        mkdir [drive:][path]dirname
    
        [drive:][path]: Specifies the drive and path where the new directory should be created. If not specified, the directory is created in the current working directory.
        dirname: Specifies the name of the new directory.

    Example:
        mkdir C:\NewFolder
        
        This example creates a new directory named "NewFolder" in the root of the C: drive.

    Additional Information:
        The mkdir command is synonymous with the md command; both can be used interchangeably to create directories.
        If the specified path does not exist, the mkdir command will attempt to create all necessary directories in the specified path.
        If the specified directory already exists, the command will complete successfully without making any changes.
