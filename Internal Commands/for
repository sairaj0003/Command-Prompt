The for command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to run a specified command for each file in a set of files. It is commonly used in batch scripts for iterating over files, performing operations on them, and processing data.
Here are the details:

    Use: The for command is used for looping through files or sets of files.

    Syntax:
        for %variable in (set) do command [command-parameters]
    
        %variable: A single character to replace the variable in the command.
        (set): A set of one or more files, separated by spaces, commas, or semicolons.
        do command: The command to be executed for each file in the set.
        [command-parameters]: Additional parameters to be passed to the command.

    Example:
        for %f in (*.txt) do type "%f"
    
        This example prints the content of each .txt file in the current directory.

    Additional Information:
        The for command is versatile and supports various options for file iteration, including wildcards and different file selection criteria.
        It can also be used for looping through a range of numbers or executing commands based on the output of other commands.
        When used in a batch script, double percent signs (%%) are used for variables, but when used directly in the Command Prompt, a single percent sign (%) is used.

For more details and options, you can use the for /? command in the Command Prompt to see the help information. The for command is a powerful tool for automating tasks involving files and data processing in a Windows environment.
