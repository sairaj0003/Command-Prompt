Additional Information:
    The ren command can be used to change the name of a file or directory in the same location.
    It's important to provide the full or relative path to the file or directory you want to rename.
    The ren command does not support wildcard characters (* or ?) for batch renaming multiple files. For that purpose, you might need to use a for loop or other methods.
