The del command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to delete one or more files from a specified location. It's a basic command for file deletion.
Here are the details:

    Use: The del command is used to delete files from a specified location.

    Syntax:
        del [/P] [/F] [/S] [/Q] [/A[[:]attributes]] names

        /P: Prompts for confirmation before deleting each file.
        /F: Forcefully deletes read-only files.
        /S: Deletes specified files from all subdirectories.
        /Q: Quiet mode (doesn't display confirmation prompts).
        /A[[:]attributes]: Selects files to delete based on attributes.
        names: Specifies the file or files to be deleted.

    Example:
        del myfile.txt
    
        This example deletes the file named "myfile.txt" in the current directory.

    Additional Information:
        The del command is a straightforward way to delete files, but it doesn't remove directories.
        If you want to delete directories along with their contents, you can use the rmdir or rd command.
        The /P option is useful when you want to confirm each file deletion.

        del /Q /S *.tmp

        This example deletes all files with the ".tmp" extension in the current directory and its subdirectories without prompting for confirmation.

The del command is a basic file management tool in the Windows Command Prompt and is often used in scripts or batch files for automating file deletion tasks.
