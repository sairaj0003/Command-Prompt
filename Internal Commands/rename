The rename command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to rename files or directories. It's an alternative to the ren command, and both can be used interchangeably for renaming.
Here are the details:

    Use: The rename command, like ren, is used to rename files or directories.

    Syntax:
        rename [old_name] [new_name]
    
        [old_name]: Specifies the current name of the file or directory.
        [new_name]: Specifies the new name for the file or directory.

    Examples:
        Rename a file:
            rename oldfile.txt newfile.txt
        
        Rename a directory:
            rename oldfolder newfolder

    Additional Information:
        The rename command is functionally equivalent to the ren command. You can use either of them based on personal preference.
        As with ren, it's important to provide the full or relative path to the file or directory you want to rename.
        The rename command does not support wildcard characters (* or ?) for batch renaming multiple files. For that purpose, you might need to use a for loop or other methods.
