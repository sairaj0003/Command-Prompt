The goto command in the Windows Command Prompt is used for transferring control to a specific label within a batch script. It allows you to create loops and conditional branching in batch files.
Here are the details:

    Use: The goto command is used to jump to a specified label in a batch script.

    Syntax:
        goto label
    
        label: Specifies the location in the script where control should be transferred.

    Example:
        @echo off
        echo This is the beginning of the script.
        goto myLabel
        echo This line will be skipped.

        :myLabel
        echo This is after the goto command.
    
        In this example, the script jumps to the label :myLabel after the goto myLabel command is encountered.

    Additional Information:
        Labels in batch scripts are defined using a colon (:) followed by the label name.
        The goto command is often used to create loops and conditional branching in batch scripts.
        It's important to use goto carefully, as improper use can lead to infinite loops or unexpected behavior.
        In modern scripting, particularly with PowerShell, more structured control flow constructs are often used, but goto remains a valid option in traditional batch scripting.

        Example of a simple loop using goto:
            @echo off
            set count=1
            
            :loop
            echo Iteration %count%
            set /A count+=1
            
            if %count% leq 5 (
              goto loop
            )
        
            In this example, the script uses goto to create a loop that iterates five times. The label :loop marks the beginning of the loop, and the script jumps back to the label until the condition is no longer met.
