The rd command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to remove or delete a directory (folder). It stands for "remove directory."
Here are the details:

    Use: The rd command is used to delete a directory from the file system.

    Syntax:
        rd /s /q directory_path
    
        /s: Removes all directories and files in the specified directory in addition to the directory itself.
        /q: Enables quiet mode. You won't be prompted for confirmation when deleting a directory and its contents.

    Examples:
        Delete an empty directory:
            rd C:\Example
        
        Delete a directory and its contents:
            rd /s /q C:\Example

    Additional Information:
        Be cautious when using the /s and /q options, especially with wildcards, as it can result in the deletion of multiple directories and files without confirmation.
        The rmdir command is an alternative to rd and has the same functionality.
        If the directory is not empty and you use rd without the /s option, you'll receive an error message.

Always double-check the directory path before using rd, especially with the /s and /q options, to avoid unintentional data loss.
