The echo command in the Windows Command Prompt is used to display messages or enable or disable the echoing feature. Here are the details:

    Use: The echo command is used to display messages or enable/disable the echoing of commands in the Command Prompt.

    Syntax:
        echo [on | off] [message]
    
        [on | off]: Enables or disables the echoing of commands. Use on to enable and off to disable.
        [message]: The text message to be displayed.

    Example:
        echo on
        echo Hello, World!
    
        This example enables echoing and then displays the message "Hello, World!".
        
    Additional Information:
        When echo is followed by a message, it displays the message on the screen.
        echo on enables the echoing of commands. echo off disables it. By default, echoing is usually on.
        Echoing is useful when you want to see the commands as they are executed, especially in batch files.
      
        echo off
        cls
      
        This example disables echoing, clears the screen, and you won't see the commands on the screen as they are executed. The cls command clears the screen.
